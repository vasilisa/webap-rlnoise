          <p><span className="bold">INFORMATION FOR THE PARTICIPANT</span></p>
          <p>You are about to participate in the research study entitled: Learning in changing environments</p>
          <p>Researcher in charge: Dr. Valentin WYART.</p> 
          <p>This study aims to understand the learning and decision-making. Its fundamental purpose is to investigate the cognitive mechanisms of these learning and decision-making processes. 
          The proposed experiment has no immediate application or clinical value, but it will allow us to improve our understanding of the brain functioning.
          We are asking you to participate in this study because you have been recruited by the RISC or Prolific platforms.</p>
          <p><span className="bold">PROCEDURE</span></p>
          <p>During your participation in this study, we will ask you to play a game, which does not require any particular competence and will last about 30 min.</p>
          <p>The game will be followed by a questionnaire that will take about 15 minutes.</p>
          <ul>
          <span className="bold">We will ask you two types of questions relating to:</span>
          <p></p>
          <li>{}Your childhood and your adult life (e.g., your current economic situation, your parents' situation as a child, etc.)</li> 
          <p></p>
          <li>{}Certain biological data that characterize your development (e.g., weight and size at birth, age at puberty, etc.).</li> 
          </ul>
          <p>Our aim is to better understand the links between people's biological development, living conditions (during childhood and adult life) and patterns of decision-making.</p>  
          <p>In total your internet-based participation will require approximately 1 hour.</p>
          <p><span className="bold">VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY</span></p>
          <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. This means that you are consenting to participate in this project without external pressure. During your participation in this project, the researcher in charge and his staff will collect and record information about you.
          In order to preserve your identity and the confidentiality of the data, the identification of each file will be coded, thus preserving the anonymity of your answers. We will not collect any personal data from the RISC or Prolific platforms. Your data will be kept confidential and 
          the researcher in charge of this study will only use the data for research purposes in order to answer the scientific objectives of the project. The data may be published in scientific journals, in which case no publication or scientific communication will contain identifying information.
