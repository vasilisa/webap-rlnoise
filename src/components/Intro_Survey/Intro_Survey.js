          <p>We are now asking you to complete a questionnaire that will take about 10-15 minutes.</p>

          <p>This study is conducted by Drs. Valentin Wyart and Pierre Jacquet - researchers at the Department of Cognitive Studies of the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure (Paris, France). 
          It aims to better understand the links between living conditions, the reproductive development and the health of individuals.</p> 
          <ul>
          <span className="bold">Three types of questions</span> will be asked, relating to:
          <p></p>
          <li>{}Your childhood and your adult life (e.g., your current economic situation, your parents' situation as a child, etc.)</li> 
          <p></p>
          <li>{}Certain biological data that characterize your development (e.g., weight and size at birth, age at puberty, etc.).</li> </ul>
          <p>All your answers will be treated in a <span className="bold">strictly confidential and anonymous</span> manner. 
          A numerical code will be automatically assigned to you at the end of the questionnaire in order to maintain your anonymity with the research team. 
          It will be impossible to use this data to identify you.</p>

          <p>Finally, the individual data collected from each participant will be aggregated to allow the researchers to better understand the variations observed in groups of participants.</p>  
          
          <p>Your participation in the questionnaire must be entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time.</p>
